		CHANGES IN PEGAS VERSION 0.2


NEW FEATURES

    o The new function site.spectrum computes the (un)folded site
      frequency spectrum of a set of DNA sequences.

    o The new function theta.tree estimates THETA from a phylogenetic tree
      under a simple coalescent model by maximum likelihood.

    o There is now a "[" method for the class "loci".

    o haplotype() has now an option 'labels' to give as rownames of
      the returned object.

    o amova() has a new option 'is.squared' to specify whether the
      distance matrix has been squared beforefand (FALSE by default).

    o write.loci() has a new argument '...' passed to write.table().

    o The functions heterozygosity, nuc.div, theta.h, theta.k and
      theta.s have been moved from ape to pegas.


BUG FIXES

    o amova() did not compute SSD correctly.

    o summary.loci() failed in the presence of NA's.
